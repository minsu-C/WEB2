      <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/">Liverpool Football Club</a>is a professional football club in Liverpool, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Domestically, the club has won <strong><u>nineteen League titles</u></strong>, seven FA Cups, a record eight League Cups and fifteen FA Community Shields. In international competitions, the club has won <strong><u>six European Cups</u></strong>, more than any other English club, <strong><u>three UEFA   Cups</u></strong>, <strong><u>four UEFA Super Cups (also English records)</u></strong> and <strong><u>one FIFA Club World Cup</u></strong>. Founded in 1892, theclub joined the Football League the following year and has played at Anfield since its formation. <strong>Liverpool established itself as a major force in English and European football in the 1970s and 1980s, when Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish led the club to a combined eleven League titles and four European   Cups</strong>. Liverpool won two further European Cups in 2005 and 2019 under the management of Rafael Benítez and Jürgen Klopp, respectively; the latter led Liverpool to anineteenth League title in 2020, the club's first during the Premier League era. Liverpool is one of the most widely supported clubs in the world, as well as one of the most valuable. Liverpool has long-standing rivalries with Manchester United and Everton. In 1964 the team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an   all-red home strip which has been used ever since. The club's anthem is "You'll Never Walk Alone". The club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies. TheHeysel Stadium disaster, where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the 1985 European Cup Final in Brussels, resulted in 39 deaths. Most of these were Italians and Juventus fans, and English clubs were given a five-year ban from European competition as a result. The Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 97   Liverpool supporters died in a crush against perimeter fencing, led to the elimination of fenced  standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadiums in the top twotiers of English football.
